## What you need (minimum viable setup)

- LED strip (ARGB or RGB — see safety notes)
- A controller (USB controller or motherboard header)
- A screen-sync software layer

## Avoid these beginner traps

- Mixing 5V ARGB with 12V RGB headers
- Running multiple RGB suites at the same time
- Using charge-only USB cables for controllers

## First success checklist

1. Get the device detected reliably (including after reboot).
2. Test sleep/wake behavior.
3. Only then optimize latency and effects.
