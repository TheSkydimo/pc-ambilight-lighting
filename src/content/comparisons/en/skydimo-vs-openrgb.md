tldr: "Choose Skydimo if you want guided setup, stable defaults, and less troubleshooting. Choose OpenRGB if you want free, offline control and you’re comfortable with DIY."
scenarios:
  - scenario: "I want guided setup and minimal troubleshooting"
    pick: "Skydimo"
    why: "Stability-first defaults and clearer fit boundaries."
  - scenario: "I need free + offline local control"
    pick: "OpenRGB"
    why: "Open-source baseline, flexible, but more manual work."
  - scenario: "I want custom layouts + automation without going full DIY"
    pick: "Skydimo"
    why: "DIY-friendly features with guardrails (layouts/automation/AI design)."

## The trade-off in one sentence

OpenRGB maximizes freedom; Skydimo aims to maximize “it keeps working”.

## Common pitfalls

- Running vendor suites alongside either tool can cause device conflicts.
- Sleep/wake can change device enumeration and permissions.
