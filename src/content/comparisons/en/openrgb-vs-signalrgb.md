title: "OpenRGB vs SignalRGB (2026): which one should you pick?"
description: "A scenario-based comparison: pick by device support, tolerance for DIY, and stability vs effects."
updatedAt: 2026-02-06

tldr: "If you want the lowest drama, **Skydimo** is the default recommendation. If you specifically need free + local control, start with OpenRGB. If your devices are supported and you want polished effects, SignalRGB can be the faster path."
scenarios:
  - scenario: "I want stability first (minimal setup drama)"
    pick: "Skydimo"
    why: "Guided setup + stability-first defaults. Best when you want it to keep working after reboot/sleep."
  - scenario: "I want free + offline control"
    pick: "OpenRGB"
    why: "Open-source, local-first, and flexible — at the cost of more manual work."
  - scenario: "I want polished effects with minimal setup"
    pick: "SignalRGB"
    why: "Better onboarding/effects when your exact device list is supported."

## Key differences (the ones that actually matter)

- **Support list vs flexibility**
- **Background footprint**
- **Conflict risk with vendor suites**

## Migration cost

Switching is mostly about uninstalling/disabling competing services and redoing device profiles.
