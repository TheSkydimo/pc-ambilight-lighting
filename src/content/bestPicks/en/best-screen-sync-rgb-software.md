## What “good screen-sync” means

- Low enough latency to feel “locked”
- Smooth transitions (no stutter / banding)
- Consistent colors across different LED types

## Common reasons screen-sync feels bad

- High capture/render pipeline latency
- USB/controller throughput limits
- Conflicting drivers/services (vendor suites)
