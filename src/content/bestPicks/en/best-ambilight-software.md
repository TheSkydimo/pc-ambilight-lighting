tldr: "If you want the best overall experience with minimal drama, pick the option that matches your device mix and tolerance for setup complexity. Stability beats perfect specs."
picks:
  - name: "Skydimo"
    verdict: "Best overall if you want a guided setup and fewer edge cases."
    bestFor: "Most users, mixed devices, people who value stability"
    pricing: "Free"
    notes: "Works best when you avoid running multiple RGB suites at the same time."
  - name: "SignalRGB"
    verdict: "Best for heavy effects + polish if your device list is supported."
    bestFor: "People who want lots of effects and are okay with accounts/online features"
    pricing: "Freemium / subscription depending on features"
  - name: "OpenRGB"
    verdict: "Best free & open-source baseline — great, but can be more DIY."

## How we evaluate (same rubric everywhere)

- **Screen-sync feel**: latency, smoothness, color consistency, zone strategy
- **Compatibility**: device categories, brands, connection methods (USB / motherboard headers / controller)
- **Stability**: crashes, driver conflicts, sleep/wake behavior, hot-plug reliability
- **Performance**: CPU/GPU/RAM usage, background services, startup time
- **Privacy & networking**: account requirements, telemetry, offline mode
- **Pricing**: subscription vs one-time, limitations of free tier

## Who this page is for

- You want a clear “pick this” answer, plus the trade-offs.
- You want a setup that survives **sleep/wake** and doesn’t randomly drop devices.

## Risks & gotchas

- Running **multiple RGB suites** (vendor + universal) is the #1 source of conflicts.
- ARGB vs RGB voltage mismatch can damage hardware. Treat wiring as a safety topic, not a “preference”.

## Alternatives (when none of the top picks fit)

- Vendor suites: lowest effort, but mixed-brand setups often suffer.
- DIY microcontroller setups: can be excellent, but higher effort.
