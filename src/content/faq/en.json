      "q": "What is Ambilight / screen-sync RGB?",
      "a": "It’s a setup where LEDs behind/around your monitor change color based on what’s on-screen, creating an ambient glow that matches the content."
    },
    {
      "q": "ARGB vs RGB — what’s the difference?",
      "a": "RGB is usually 12V 4-pin (12V+R+G+B), so the whole strip changes color together. ARGB is usually 5V 3-pin (5V+Data+GND), so each LED can be controlled individually. RGB is best for uniform static color, while ARGB supports flowing and per-LED effects."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I plug RGB and ARGB into each other?",
      "a": "No. Plugging 5V ARGB into a 12V RGB header can burn LEDs immediately; plugging 12V RGB into 5V ARGB usually will not work and can still damage hardware. Always verify pin count (3-pin vs 4-pin) and header labels before connecting."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is my device not detected?",
      "a": "Most common causes: cable/port issues (charge-only cable, flaky hub), driver/service conflicts from vendor RGB suites, or sleep/wake power settings. Start with Compatibility → Not detected."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is low latency always better?",
      "a": "Lower latency generally feels more “locked” to the screen, but stability matters more. A slightly higher-latency setup that never drops devices is often the better experience."
