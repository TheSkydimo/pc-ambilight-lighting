tldr: "OpenRGB is the best starting point if you want free and offline control. Expect more manual work and device-specific quirks."
pros:
  - "Free and open-source"
  - "Offline-friendly"
  - "Good base for mixed-brand experimentation"
cons:
  - "Device support can be uneven"
  - "Setup and troubleshooting are more DIY"
  - "Conflicts with vendor suites are common"

## Who it’s for / not for

**For**: tinkerers, people who prefer local control, mixed-brand users who can troubleshoot.  
**Not for**: “install once and never touch it” users, or anyone relying on vendor suites simultaneously.

## Compatibility and stability notes

Treat compatibility as a *matrix*, not a promise. Always note your device model + firmware + connection method.

## Installation: common pitfalls

- Vendor suites running in the background can re-take control.
- Sleep/wake can change USB device enumeration order.
