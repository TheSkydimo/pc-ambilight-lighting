tldr: "Vendor suites are easiest for single-brand builds. They’re often the source of conflicts when you try to add a universal controller on top."
pros:
  - "Simple onboarding for supported single-brand hardware"
  - "Tight integration for that brand"
cons:
  - "Mixed-brand control is usually poor"
  - "Background services can conflict with universal tools"
  - "Sleep/wake and re-enumeration issues are common"

## When vendor suites make sense

- You only care about one brand’s ecosystem.
- You prefer “works well enough” over universal control.

## When they become a problem

- You add a second controller (universal tool) and both fight for control.
- You want consistent behavior across sleep/wake and hot-plug.
