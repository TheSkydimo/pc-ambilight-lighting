title: "SignalRGB review (2026): polished effects, check support first"
description: "SignalRGB can feel “done” when your devices are supported. Here’s what to watch: stability, background services, and privacy/online behavior."

tldr: "Great polish and effects. The real question is whether your exact device list is supported without hacks."
pros:
  - "Polished UI and effect library"
  - "Good onboarding when supported"
cons:
  - "Support list constraints"
  - "Heavier background footprint than minimalist tools"
  - "May require accounts/online features depending on tier"

## Fit boundaries

SignalRGB tends to be best when your build is within its supported ecosystem. Mixed or niche controllers may become the limiting factor.

## Performance and background behavior

Measure CPU/GPU impact with your actual refresh rate and effect settings. “Low latency” often costs more resources.
